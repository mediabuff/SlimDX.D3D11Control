# SlimDX.D3D11Control
SlimDX.D3D11Control is a D3D11-aware WinForms control for use with SlimDX. It takes care of the boilerplate of device context initialization and swapchain setup. It also provides a couple of useful properties for configuring vertical synchronization, setting the rasterizer's cull- and fillmode, etc.

### Usage

To use the library add the SlimDX.D3D11Control.dll assembly to your project references in Visual Studio. Of course, you will also have to have added a reference to SlimDX. After adding the reference, the D3D11Control component should automatically popup in the Toolbox window from which you can then simply drag it onto a form.

### Documentation

Documentation is not available, I suggest you just dig into the code; it's pretty well documented so it shouldn't be too hard to figure things out.
